# pseudocode
A library/header file for C++ which allows my students to write in pseudocode and compile programs. You can change the names to fit your language (mine is in Romanian). Hope this helps someone, eventually.

The file "main.cpp" is a test I made while teaching. It compiles, builds and runs.
I made in the span of 10 minutes. For what I am doing with my students, it's perfect. I have no plans of improving it in the future, but I am open to modifications, suggestions, improvements.
